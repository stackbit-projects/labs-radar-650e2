At [Fount](https://www.fountstudio.com), we like to try out new ideas – new ideas in areas where we have strong interests. Radar Love is our latest foray. We want to provide a clean, simple method to get beautiful radar imagery. We think that personlized data will unlock novel ways to enhance a business process, company branding or show that radar data does not have to look like it was stuck in the 90s.
